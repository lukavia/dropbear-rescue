Description: lightweight SSH2 server and client - initramfs rescue integration
 dropbear is a SSH 2 server and client designed to be small enough to
 be used in small memory environments, while still being functional and
 secure enough for general use.
 .
 It implements most required features of the SSH 2 protocol, and other
 features such as X11 and authentication agent forwarding.
 .
 This package provides initramfs integration that runs in rescue mode
